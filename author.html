        <h2>I hosted this website because the <a href=https://glitch.me>glitch.me</a>domain was blocked, so I resorted to using Render, which worked for my school. I certainly do not want to discredit the geniuses behind these exploits, so if you would like to host the official version on Render, please contact me and we can work out a solution ASAP.</h2>
